# The Royal Game Of Ur
                                                            
A long time ago, this game was as common as chess. You could go anywhere and  
people would know how to play it.                                             
                                                                              
Each turn, you roll 4 dice with 4 sides. 2 sides each would be marked, making 
a 50/50 chance of a die coming up marked. You count the marked dice to get the
amount of steps you'll move a piece this turn.                                
                                                                              
Each player has 7 pieces to get across the board. The first to all 7 wins.    
You can reset an opponent piece by landing on it. If you land on a * then you 
get another placement. A piece on a * cannot be taken. An exact roll is needed
to get a piece onto the final position.                                       
                                                                              
Use left and right arrow keys and ENTER.
